SECTION 2: TECHNOLOGY / NATURAL INTELLIGENCE
================================================================================

Section Title: Natural Intelligence
               Patented Physical Response

Intro paragraph:
Airshade's patented actuator uses the sun's heat to expand trapped air -- creating pressure that physically moves shading panels.

How It Works (3 steps):

  Step 1: Air Expands with Heat
  Sunlight heats sealed air chambers inside the actuator

  Step 2: Pressure Rises
  Expanding air creates mechanical force

  Step 3: Shading Units Move
  Panels tilt to block direct sunlight

Tagline: No sensor. No motor. No power.

SECTION 3: BENEFITS / SMART FACADES REINVENTED
================================================================================

Section Title: Smart Facades
               Reinvented

Benefit 1: Zero Running Costs
Powered entirely by the sun -- no electricity, no cables, no ongoing energy costs. No motors or sensors means dramatically lower CapEx and near-zero OpEx over the entire building lifecycle.

Benefit 2: Plug & Play
No wiring, no control systems, no infrastructure changes required. Airshade retrofits onto new and existing buildings alike -- simply mount and it works from day one.

Benefit 3: Silent & Durable
No motors means no noise -- perfect for residential and office environments. Mechanical simplicity ensures decades of quiet, reliable operation without component failure.

Benefit 4: Future-Proof
Fully compliant with the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD). While electronics fail after 15 years, Airshade's passive system outlasts the building facade itself.

Markus Wines Winery:
  Tag: Lighthouse Project
  Description: The first permanent building installation of Airshade technology. Approximately 100 passive shading units protect the winery from intense Croatian summer sun while maintaining views of the surrounding vineyard landscape.
  Meta: Split, Croatia -- ~100 units installed
  Partners: metadecor

SOMBRA Pavilion:
  Tag: 2025 Pavilion of the Year (Archello Awards)
  Description: A kinetic shading pavilion at the Venice Architecture Biennale featuring Airshade's passive actuator technology. The installation demonstrates how shading can respond to sunlight without any electronics or motors, creating a mesmerizing display of natural adaptation.
  Meta: Venice, Italy
  Partners: ARUP, MVRDV, metadecor, Van Rossum Raadgevend Ingenieurs, Kersten, Alumet

Masdar City Pilot:
  Tag: Extreme Climate Testing
  Description: A pilot project in partnership with ARUP to test Airshade technology under extreme desert conditions. The installation validates performance in temperatures exceeding 45 degrees C with intense solar radiation.
  Meta: Abu Dhabi, UAE
  Partners: ARUP, metadecor

Hogeschool Utrecht:
  Tag: EU Retrofit Project
  Description: EU SME Phase 1 grant project demonstrating how existing electric-driven facades can be replaced with Airshade's passive system. This retrofit showcases the potential for upgrading Europe's aging building stock.
  Meta: Netherlands -- EU SME Phase 1 Grant
  Partners: Schellekens, Protospace
